Game INTRODUCTION:

The general goal of this game is to eliminate all of your opponents ships.
	by selecting spots on the game board to see if you hit or miss.

The game is over when one player loses all of their ships.

At the beginning of the game each player will setup their boats on a 10x10
	grid simulating a board.
You cannot use the same space for two ships.

You will have the choice between playing 1 to 6 ships that you can place
	on the board.

Types of ships depends on the amount of ships chosen:
	These are for each player:

for a game with 1 SHIP:
	1 SUB (1x1)

	Battleship: (1x5), Battleship: (1x6)

On the board, there is a few symbols that represent the ships, hits, misses
	and the board itself:
	'.' = PORTION OF BOARD NOT INTERACTED WITH,
	'H'= HIT
	'M' = MISS
	'S'= 1st SHIP (Vertically or Horizontally)
	'S S' = 2nd SHIP
	'S S S' = 3rd SHIP
	'S S S S' = 4th SHIP
	'S S S S S' = 5th SHIP
	'S S S S S S' = 6th SHIP

There are Multiple Game modes you can choose from!

PLAYER VS PLAYER :

This MODE is Fairly straightforward, both players will take turns setting up
	their boards.
You will be prompted to place your ships, specifying the grid placement and the
	direction they will be facing.
After placement is complete you will be prompted to choose GRID POSITIONS to
	attack.
If a attack HITS you will see a 'H' on the GRID, on the position you choose to
	attack.
If it FAILS you will see a 'M' on the GRID, on the position you choose to
	attack.
The First player to sink all ships wins!!
Good luck!

Player vs AI:

In this mode 1 Player goes against a AI opponent in a Difficult level of their
	choosing.
First the Player Chooses the Difficulty LEVEL:
EASY MODE - AI attacks randomly!

MEDIUM MODE - AI starts attacking randomly, but if it hits, then it targets the
	adjacent ROWS and COLUMNS till the ship is sunk.

HARD MODE - AI has hacked your communications!! It knows exactly where you are.
	Each turn will be a hit, You can win but any misses will cost you the game!
